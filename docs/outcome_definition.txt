Outcome Definition: Concurrent Child Undernutrition Classes

This project models concurrent child undernutrition outcomes for Young Lives Ethiopia.
The outcome classes are:
- N: No undernutrition
- U: Underweight only
- S: Stunting only
- W: Wasting only
- US: Underweight + Stunting
- UW: Underweight + Wasting
- USW: Underweight + Stunting + Wasting

WHO z-score thresholds
- Stunting: height-for-age z-score (HAZ) < -2
- Wasting: weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) < -2
- Underweight: weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) < -2

Class labels are derived from the combination of these indicators.
